    "Python is considered to behave as an excellent adhesive between different programming languages.  Most of what we have seen along those lines thus far involves invoking shell programs indirectly, perhaps via IPython's `!` notation or by using `sys` or `os.popen`.  However, many performance-critical modules in Python, such as NumPy, have substantial components written in C or other high-performance languages.  We'll examine several ways to interface or incorporate other languages—particularly C and Fortran—into your Python program in this lesson."

    "\n",
    "As is probably now clear to you, Python is a flexible and easy-to-use language. The programmer time required to program a new model or calculation is typically quite short.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this reduction in human time, comes at the expense of increasing computation time, especially when we are talking about calculations which involve iterating over large arrays. Interpreted languages (MATLAB, Python, Perl, Ruby, etc.) are thus categorically slower than low-level compiled languages (C, C++, Fortran, etc.).  On the other hand, writing lengthy programs in C and FORTRAN is a cumbersome task. This tradeoff is one motivation to code the expensive chunks in C or FORTRAN and glue the bigger picture with Python.\n",

    "[Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) (**For**mula **Tran**slation) was introduced in 1954 for numeric and scientific computing.  Fortran is compiled to machine code for the purpose of speed, and it serves as the benchmark for high-performance computing even today.  Despite ongoing criticisms, it has managed to survive and adapt for nearly sixty years.  Fortran still exists and dominates HPC due to both its computational performance and *software inertia*—the enormously large body of legacy code written in Fortran.\n",

    "\n",

    "When working with the IPython notebook environment, there is a convenient way of compiling and loading Cython code.  Using the `%%cython` IPython magic, we can simply type the Cython code in a code cell and let IPython take care of the conversion to C code, compilation and loading of the function.  To be able to use the `%%cython` magic in IPython, we first need to load the extension `cythonmagic`:"
